# Lessons Learned
Learned how to build web applications using the Django framework and the Model-View-Template (MVT) structure. Strengthened my understanding of Python and learned how to implement CRUD operations using both Function-Based Views (FBV) and Class-Based Views (CBV). Since I handled the styling with raw CSS instead of libraries like Bootstrap, I got more comfortable working with layout tools like flexbox, especially when creating cards and containers. It was also my first time using Git and GitHub.
